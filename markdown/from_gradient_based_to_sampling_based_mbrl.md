title: "Gradient-Based vs. Sampling-Based MBRL"
---
* One advantage of gradient-based MBRL is that it can learn control policies more efficiently, since it can use the gradients of the expected return to guide the optimization process.
* On the other hand, sampling-based MBRL can be more robust to model errors and uncertainties, since it uses the model only to sample a set of possible trajectories and does not rely on the model to compute gradients.
