title: "Gradient-Based MBRL"
---
In gradient-based MBRL, the control policy is typically represented as a function of the system state, and the goal is to find the parameters of this function that maximize the expected return of the policy.
To optimize the policy, gradient-based MBRL algorithms compute the gradients of the expected return with respect to the policy parameters and use these gradients to update the policy iteratively.
