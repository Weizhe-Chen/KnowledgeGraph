title: "Linear Quadratic Regulator"
---
Linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is a classical control method that uses a mathematical model of the system and a cost function to solve for the optimal control policy.
LQR is a model-based method that assumes that the system is linear and time-invariant, and it uses optimization and calculus to solve for the optimal control policy, based on the dynamic equations of the system and the quadratic cost function.
