title: "Model-Based vs. Model-Free"
---
Model-based and model-free algorithms have different strengths and weaknesses.
Model-based algorithms can be more **efficient** and **faster to converge** than model-free algorithms, because they can use the model to plan the optimal action sequence and avoid suboptimal actions.
However, model-based algorithms can also be **more complex and computationally expensive** than model-free algorithms, because they need to learn or estimate the model of the environment, which can be difficult in some cases.
Model-free methods can be slower to converge and less efficient than model-based algorithms, especially in environments with **long-term dependencies** or **sparse rewards**.
